"""
diffusion_models
================

A module that provides functionalities to define diffusion models.

To create a diffusion model, one must define:
    - The forward and reverse stochastic differential equations
    - The time integration method

Modules
-------
differential_equations  : Provides various differential equations for diffusion models
time_integrators        : Provides methods to perform time integration
