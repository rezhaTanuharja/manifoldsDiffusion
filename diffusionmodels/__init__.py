"""
diffusionmodels
===============

A module that provides functionalities to define diffusion models.

To create a diffusion model, one must define:
    - The forward and reverse stochastic differential equations
    - The time integration method

Modules
-------
differentialequations   : Provides various differential equations for diffusion models
timeintegrators         : Provides methods to perform time integration
