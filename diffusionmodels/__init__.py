diffusionmodels
===============

A package that provides functionalities to define diffusion models in manifolds.

Modules
-------
manifolds               : Provides manifold structures
differentialequations   : Provides stochastic differntial equations
timeintegrators         : Provides time integration methods
recorders               : Provides means to store SDE solutions
solvers                 : Provides SDE solvers
dataprocessing          : Provides functionalities to define data preprocessing steps
scorefunctions          : Provides functionalities to compute pseudo "Stein score function"
utilities               : Provides various useful functions
